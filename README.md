# MeshViewer OpenGL

I started to learn OpenGL. Therefore i decided to implement a .msh viewer for SWBFII assets, since the old one
is not very good. But we don't have the source, so i start from the beginning.
Why OpenGL for a viewer?
well that way i can display specular and normal maps and maybe show animations, too.

### Licence

licence, too.
